# cassandra_modeling
This project is an example of how to create an ETL pipeline using Python and Apache Cassandra. This involved transferring from a set of raw CSV user files within a directory to make a new modified CSV file to create Apache Cassandra tables. A few example queries were made after creating Cassandra tables.
The data used for this project came from the "Million Song Dataset" along with an event similator (see github page for a description: https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) 

Files:

1) event_data - directory of the CSV user files (not real data, only simulated)

2) Project_1B_Project_Template.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the ETL pipeline for Apache Cassandra table creation and querie execution.
